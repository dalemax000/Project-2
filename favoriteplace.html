                I've only been to the island a few times, but that's enough to know it's my favorite place. 
                Every time I visited the Toronto Islands, it was the perfect weather and not too crowded.
                A lot of people visit, yet I always feel like I have the place to myself. Bridges connect each island, and
                bikes can be rented for easy travel.
