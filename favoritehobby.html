        <h2>Music Production</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>I've been producing since October in 2023. Since then, I have gotten much better at the craft. 
            Even producing some songs for a few rappers. If I see enough recognition and success, turning this 
        hobby into a full career is definitely an interesting option.</h4>
